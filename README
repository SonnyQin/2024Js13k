Treasure Monster on the End block

Check for the lifespan

Long ago, there stood an ancient castle with a mysterious chamber hidden within, containing a priceless treasure.
However, this castle fell victim to the invasion of the Thirteen Gods.
The souls of these gods possessed many of the items in the chamber, imbuing them with unspeakable malevolence.
These possessed objects not only sense your presence but also silently pursue you like shadows in the dark, ever ready to engulf anyone daring enough to seek the treasure.
To uncover the hidden wealth, you must enter this chamber, unravel its mysteries, and face these intangible threats with courage.
