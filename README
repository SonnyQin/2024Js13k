items which labels 13's tracing. The game will have fog to render the scary atmoshpere and unique sound

Speed detection: When players are in devil's range, detect the speed, to determine whether
will the monster be active.

Monsters may moving or not moving

Monsters that will attack the player will have red 13 on it

Monster's 13 sign may be blinking, means it will turn off for several seconds and appear

alternatively, using the emojis to determine whether monsters are around, the red thirteen will appear only in
the pursuiting range of the monster
I prefer the second one

Monster may wander around if the target is lost
